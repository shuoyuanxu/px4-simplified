# px4-simplified  

The reason I made this is to help understanding the framework of PX4 and also to prepare a clean enviroment for future functionalities development.    

only two modes left: attitude and position(modified altitude mode) control  Â 

if you want to use, try replace two files in the dirctory listed bellow:  

Firmware\src\modules\mc_pos_control 

Firmware\src\modules\mc_att_control 

only compatible with a few old versions  

if you have any questions, please contact me 1067542448@qq.com
